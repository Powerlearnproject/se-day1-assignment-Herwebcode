#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software Engineering can be defined as the process of using set principles in designing, building and maintaining software.
It is the power house of any technological products which helps solve numerous problems in the technology industry and society at large. for example, the development of mobile app 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer: 
The structured programming in the 1960s which created a shift from unstructured code to orgnaised made software more readable nad maintainable
The object-oriented programming in the 1980s which created more flexibility in software designs and reusuable code by introducing the concept of objects
The Agile methodologies in the late 20th century which emphasized an iterative approach in the development cycles that in turn promote collaboration between teams and stakeholders

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Understanding the requirments: This is where the whole development team come together with the customer or client to discuss the project requirments e.g what the product will look like, functions and outcome required/expected. This also includes how to achieve the goal or solve the problem.
2.Requirement Analysis
this analysis will be done to identify and record the precise requirement of the final users, which is also called requirement gathering
3. Designing
the design team will be build the framework by creating mock ups and ensure its user friendly and perform its tasks effectively
4.building nad development
ths is where the development team build a funtional software using the programming code that aligns with the vision set in the earlier phases.

5. testing and integration
   this is the inspection of functioins that have been built whether it meets the rquirement or not, so that the product will either e deployed or return to  the team for enhancement.
   
6.Deployment:
this involves rolling out the already tested product accepted by the team and stakeholders in to the market for the end users

7. Maintenance
this phase involves the constant assistance, resolving unexpected issues, upgrading of the software and fixing bugs to ensure it meets customer expectations and last longer.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Water fall approach is a method of software development life cycle that follows linear  sequence. In this approach, clear requirement is ephasizedand each stage must be completed before moving to the next. the cost defect is a very big factor in using water fall approach because the defect is found at a later stage and the process takes very long to be completed which will delay project delivery. waterfall approach will work once the requirement is clear.

While Agile is a very flexible approach for software development life cycle. it provides continous feedback because chnages or updates can be done quickly compare to the water fall approach. This iterative development model delivers the value to customer quickly and each team repests the same cycle process

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer: Software developers work in the team , design and develop ideas, write clean and secure code, test and debug, deplloy software application, maintain systems once they start running, collaborate with teams, learn new technologies, participate in code reviews & documentations, and prepare user training manual.

A Quality Assurrance Engineer in the software engineering team is responsible for ensuring the quality of a software product meets functional and non functional requirements before launching. This process includes planning, design, writing test cases, and defect management. e.t.c 

A project manager is the one that assigns task to the software engineering teams and evaluate their team's performance using their leadership skills, technical knowledge and experiernce and also to guide the team and esure software meets client requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applications that help developer to code efficiciently which include a text editor, tool bar, project editor. in other words, IDE is a software application that combined many functions in an easy to use application to increase developers productivity. Visual studio, IntelliJ and Eclipse.

VCS is very important in software development process as it helps in collaboration among different teams involve in SDLC, it also helps in tracking changes made to the code over time. Example includes Git and Github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common chllenges include: Complex debugging which can be overcome by practicing robust testing, coolaboration issues can be overcome with an effective project management, unclear requirements can be overcome by encouraging a very clear communication means, security concerns can be overcome by implementing robust security measures and staying up to date on security practices, and rapidly changing technology will be overcome by encouraging engineers to continue learning.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing ia a practice where the smallest components (unit) of a software are examined to verify its unit's functionality. this process helps in early bug detection which inturn saves time and cost. Also, it helps in planning and setting up the environment.

Integration testing: this is a method the units in a module are tested together, to verify their functionality and interaction to ensure smooth communication of data exchange between them. This is to identify defects that will occur when systems are integrated.
this helps in system stability, early bug detection an improved user experience.

System testing is done when all the modules have been integrated to verify whether all components work together as intended. It is considered a critical part of QA as it helps in comprehensive evaluation to identify potential defects and issues within the whole system. It helps in reducing risk before deployment and improves reliability and confidence in the software product verifying that all system components function together.

Acceptance testing is crucial phase in SDLC, when the product has been developed and almost getting deployed into the market, the end user test the functionality and useability esuring it meets their needs serving as the final QA check before release. This is important to enhance customer satisfaction, helps to reduce cost , mitigate risk and improved product quality.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of writing instructions to help AI models produce accurate and relevant responses. It allows the user to control the AI output by providing a clear and detailed instruction. It also act as a brigde between human intent and the AI's capabilities

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example of a vague prompt 
 Give me a blog topic about food.
 more clearly: I'm looking to write a blog post about unique vegan desserts fron around the world. can you provide a breakdown of five such desserts with their countries of origin and main ingredients.

 Explanantion:
 The first prompt is too general. while it does ask for a topic about food, ChatGPT might come up with a wide range of suggestions, which might not align with what you had in mind.
 The revised prompt narrows down the request to a specific niche within food blogging (vegan dessserts) and even provides a format for the desired output (a breakdown of five desserts).
